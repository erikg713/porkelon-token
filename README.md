### Porkelon-Token (PORK) ###
-------------------------
is an upgradable ERC-20 token on the Polygon network, originally from moonshot Solana via smart contract upgrade to Polygon Network. Designed as a meme/utility token with a capped supply of 100 billion tokens. It includes features like burnability, pausability, ownable control, a 1% transaction fee to a team wallet, and predefined allocations for dev, staking/rewards, liquidity, marketing, airdrops, and presale. 
The token is non-mintable after initialization to enforce the max supply.
This repository contains:
The main token smart contract (PorkelonPolygon.sol).
A presale contract (PorkelonPresale.sol).
Bash scripts for adding liquidity (scripts/add_liquidity.sh) and locking liquidity (scripts/lock_liquidity.sh).
Deployment and usage instructions.
The project emphasizes low fees on Polygon, upgradeability via UUPS proxy, and community trust through liquidity locking.

🔄 Porkelon Token Migration Plan

1. Snapshot on Solana

Freeze or mark the final supply on Solana (1B).

Take a snapshot of all Solana holders + balances (via Solscan or Solana program).

Export snapshot to CSV/JSON for migration mapping.


2. Deploy Porkelon v2 on Polygon

Deploy the PorkelonPolygon.sol contract (100B supply).

Tokenomics built in:

✅ Staking (10%) → 10B PORK

✅ Airdrops (5%) → 5B PORK

✅ Presale (25%) → 25B PORK

✅ Rewards (10%) → 10B PORK

✅ Team (25%) → 25B PORK (vesting recommended)

✅ Liquidity Lock (25%) → 25B PORK (locked 365 days)


HOW TO CLAIM YOUR AIRDROP Coding partner

Show thinking
No problem, you don't need a custom website. There are easier ways for your community to claim the airdrop.

The only thing your users need is a way to get their specific amount and proof from the proofs.json file. Here are two great options.

Option 1 (Recommended): Use a Third-Party Airdrop Tool
The easiest and most professional solution is to use a pre-built airdrop claiming tool. Many launchpad platforms offer this as a service.

How it works: You, as the project owner, connect your wallet to their platform. You provide your PorkelonAirdrop contract address and simply upload the proofs.json file you generated.

What users see: The platform gives you a unique link. Your community members can go to this link, connect their wallet, and the tool will automatically find their proof and show a simple "Claim" button.

Examples: Platforms like Pinksale, Gempad, and others have these tools built-in. Look for a "Merkle Airdrop" or "Airdrop Claim" tool on a platform you trust.

This is the best option for user experience, as it's simple and requires no technical skill from your community.

Option 2 (Simple & Free): Host the proofs.json File Publicly
This is a more manual but completely free alternative.

Upload the File: Upload your proofs.json file to a public place, like a GitHub repository.

Share the Link: Share the direct link to the proofs.json file with your community.

Instruct Users to Claim Manually: Provide your community with instructions on how to find their proof and use it on a block explorer.

How Users Claim Manually
A user would follow these steps:

Open the proofs.json file link you shared.

Press Ctrl+F to search for their own wallet address.

Copy their balance and their proof array.

Go to your PorkelonAirdrop contract's page on a block explorer (like Polygonscan).

Go to the "Contract" -> "Write Contract" tab and connect their wallet.

Find the claim function.

Paste their amount and proof into the correct fields and click "Write" to submit the transaction.

> Allocation happens at deployment: contract mints and distributes automatically.



3. Bridge/Migration Process

Since Solana ↔ Polygon are different chains, you can’t “move” tokens directly. Instead:

Burn old Solana supply (send to dead address).

Distribute new Polygon tokens based on snapshot:

Create a claim portal (DApp) where old holders can claim new PORK by proving Solana ownership.

Alternatively, airdrop Polygon PORK directly to their mapped wallets (if you collect addresses).



4. Liquidity Lock (365 Days)

Use Unicrypt / Team Finance / Gnosis Safe to lock liquidity tokens from DEX (like QuickSwap).

Lock duration: 365 days minimum.


5. Presale + Staking + Rewards

Presale handled via a Presale contract (users send MATIC/USDT, get PORK).

Staking contract: users stake PORK to earn rewards.
Next Steps for Deployment
Prepare .env:
Copy .env.example to .env:
cp .env.example .env
Fill in real values:
PRIVATE_KEY: Your wallet’s private key (never share it).
RPC URLs: Use reliable providers (e.g., Alchemy, Infura) for POLYGON_RPC and MUMBAI_RPC.
Wallet addresses: Ensure all allocation wallets (TEAM_WALLET, etc.) are valid Ethereum addresses.
API keys: Get a POLYGONSCAN_API_KEY from Polygonscan for contract verification.
Test Locally:
Start a local Hardhat node:
npx hardhat node
Deploy to the local network:
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network hardhat
Write tests in test/ folder using Mocha/Chai to verify contract behavior.
Test on Mumbai:
Fund your deployer wallet with MATIC on Mumbai (use a faucet like https://mumbaifaucet.com).
Run:
./scripts/deploy.sh mumbai
Verify the contract on Polygonscan (Mumbai explorer).
Deploy to Polygon Mainnet:
Ensure your deployer wallet has enough MATIC for gas (check gas prices on https://polygonscan.com/gastracker).
Run:
./scripts/deploy.sh polygon
Verify the contract on Polygonscan.
Post-Deployment:
Save the contract address from deployed-address.txt.
Verify the contract on Polygonscan (if not automated in deploy.js).
If the contract is an ERC-20 token, add it to DEXs (e.g., QuickSwap) or update token metadata on CoinMarketCap (using COINMARKETCAP_API_KEY).

WALLET INTEGRATION 
--------------------------
Wallet Integration
Porkelon (PORK) is an ERC-20 token on Polygon (chain ID: 137). Users can add it to wallets like MetaMask and Trust Wallet for viewing balances, sending/receiving, and interacting with dApps (e.g., staking or presale).
Manual Addition Instructions
MetaMask (Desktop/Mobile)
Open MetaMask and switch to Polygon Mainnet (if not added: Settings > Networks > Add Network; RPC: https://polygon-rpc.com, Chain ID: 137, Symbol: POL, Explorer: https://polygonscan.com).
In Assets tab, click "Import tokens".
Enter:
Token Contract Address: 0xYourDeployedPorkelonAddressHere
Token Symbol: PORK
Token Decimals: 18
Click "Add Custom Token" > "Import Tokens".
Trust Wallet (Mobile)
Open Trust Wallet app.
Search for "Polygon" and add the network if needed (similar details as above).
On the main screen, tap "+" (Add Custom Token).
Select Polygon network, paste contract address: 0xYourDeployedPorkelonAddressHere.
It auto-fills symbol (PORK) and decimals (18). Tap "Save".
Automated Addition (Website/dApp Integration)
For your project site, add buttons to trigger wallet APIs. This uses Ethereum Provider API (injected by wallets). Works for MetaMask (desktop/browser extension) and Trust Wallet (via WalletConnect or in-app browser).
