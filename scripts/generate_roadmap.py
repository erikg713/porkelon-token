## Where to place files in your repo (recommended structure)

```

```

## How to use the Python generator script
I included a generator script (`scripts/generate_roadmap.py`) that writes `docs/roadmap.md`. Run it locally or in CI:

```bash
python3 scripts/generate_roadmap.py
```

It will overwrite `docs/roadmap.md` with the current roadmap content.

---

## Notes
- Keep `docs/` docs under source control and update them as tasks complete.
- Use PRs to change roadmap or tokenomics so the community can review.
- For sensitive keys or scripts that require private keys (e.g., adding liquidity), never commit secrets â€” use environment variables or GitHub Actions secrets.
