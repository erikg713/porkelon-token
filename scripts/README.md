Add Monad Testnet to MetaMask (RPC details)

You can add the network manually in MetaMask using these settings:

Network Name: Monad Testnet

RPC URL: https://testnet-rpc.monad.xyz. 

Chain ID: 10143. 

Currency Symbol: MON. 

Block Explorer (optional): https://testnet.monadexplorer.com. 


(You can also use other public RPC endpoints like https://monad-testnet.drpc.org or provider endpoints from Alchemy / Ankr / QuickNode if you prefer.) 


Get test MON (faucets)

After creating your testnet address, use a testnet faucet to get MON for gas:

Official Monad faucet / portal: https://faucet.monad.xyz/. 

QuickNode faucet for Monad testnet: https://faucet.quicknode.com/monad/testnet. 

Other public faucets / dev tools (if one is rate-limited): QuickNode / OpenBuild / RPC provider faucets listed in the Monad docs. 


Notes: Some faucets have rules (e.g., require an earlier mainnet activity or small rate limits). If an official faucet is down, try community faucets (QuickNode, OpenBuild) or Monad Discord for dev help.
